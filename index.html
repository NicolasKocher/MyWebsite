          For my first HTML and CSS project, I created a replica of the Youtube page. 
          During this project, I gained experience in using various design techniques 
          such as Flexboxes, Grids, and Transitions. This project allowed me to develop 
          a strong foundation in web design principles and gave me a deeper understanding 
          of the general structure of a website.
        </p>
        <p class="first-project-text">
          Through this project, I was able to apply my skills and knowledge of HTML and CSS 
          to create a visually appealing and functional website. The use of Flexboxes and Grids 
          allowed me to create a responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes. 
          Transitions were utilized to add an element of interactivity to the website, enhancing 
          the overall user experience.
        </p>
        <p class="first-project-text">
          Overall, this project was an excellent learning experience that allowed me to gain practical 
          skills in web design. It has given me the confidence to take on more complex projects in the 
          future and I am excited to continue developing my skills as a web designer.

          My second website project was for a hearing aid company based in Zurich, 
          which had recently opened its doors. Although I started with a template, I 
          learned a great deal during this project and was able to create a unique 
          website that met the customer's requirements.
        </p>
        <p class="first-project-text">
          This project was particularly interesting because it involved working with a 
          client for the first time. I had the opportunity to communicate directly with 
          the client and to collaborate with them on the website design. This experience 
          allowed me to gain insight into the importance of effective communication and 
          how to tailor a website to meet a client's specific needs.
